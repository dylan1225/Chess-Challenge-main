framework from Sebastian Lague

my engine is in Mybot.cs located at chess-challenge/src/mybot/mybot.cs

all I used was the API, the framework it self was not uci compatible and run in a GUI, so I have to make it UCI compatible, the API is similar to python chess library
changes I made to make it UCI compatible can be find in src/framework/application/challengecontroller.cs and program.cs, I commented out previous code because I want to come back and use the GUI.
